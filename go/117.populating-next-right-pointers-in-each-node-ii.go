 * Total Accepted:    302.1K
 * Total Submissions: 731.2K
 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4,5,null,7]'
 *
 * Given a binary tree
 *
 *
 * struct Node {
 * ⁠ int val;
 * ⁠ Node *left;
 * ⁠ Node *right;
 * ⁠ Node *next;
 * }
 *
 *
 * Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no
 * next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
 *
 * Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
 *
 *
 *
 * Follow up:
 *
 *
 * You may only use constant extra space.
 * Recursive approach is fine, you may assume implicit stack space does not
 * count as extra space for this problem.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
 * Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#]
 * Explanation: Given the above binary tree (Figure A), your function should
 * populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in
 * Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next
 * pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * The number of nodes in the given tree is less than 6000.
 * -100 <= node.val <= 100
