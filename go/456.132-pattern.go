 *
 * Given an arrayÂ of n integers nums, a 132 pattern is a subsequence of three
 * integers nums[i], nums[j] and nums[k] such that i < j < k and nums[i] <
 * nums[k] < nums[j].
 *
 * Return true if there is a 132 pattern in nums, otherwise, return false.
 *
 * Follow up: The O(n^2) is trivial, could you come up with the O(n logn) or
 * the O(n) solution?
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: There is no 132 pattern in the sequence.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: nums = [3,1,4,2]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: There is a 132 pattern in the sequence: [1, 4, 2].
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: nums = [-1,3,2,0]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: There are three 132 patterns in the sequence: [-1, 3, 2], [-1,
 * 3, 0] and [-1, 2, 0].
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * n == nums.length
 * 1 <= n <= 10^4
 * -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
