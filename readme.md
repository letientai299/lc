# Leetcode solutions

## Note

- Grep `faster` or `TODO` for those problem that I didn't achieve 100% time or has
  something else to do.
- Review and filter the list of interesting problems.
- To other people, most of the code here is ugly, especially for those
  uninteresting problems to me.

## Interesting problems

- [5 - Longest Palindromic Subtring](./go/5.longest-palindromic-substring.go)

  problems, can be followed up with many system design topics for real life
  implementation.
